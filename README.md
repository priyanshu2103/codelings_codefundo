OUR AIM

Our aim is giving quality assistance in the aftermath of a natural disaster. We plan to do this by providing a common platform for relief groups, NGOs, volunteer groups, individual volunteers to work together.

We believe, by doing this, all of us will be able to furnish better assistance to the needy.

We will store information about the contact details of people willing to volunteer, money, food packets and medicines donated by people, various governmental and non-governmental agencies, space available in all the relief centres and hospitals. This will help to manage the relief operations more efficiently.
All the volunteers working in a region will be able to communicate with each other easily with our platform.

FUTURE PROSPECT

All the information which we store can be used for any disaster in the future. With our database, prejudgment of the number of relief centres, food packets and manpower needed can be easily made which will be very useful. The better we are prepared, the better we can minimize the damage.

ADD ON  

With time, we plan to upgrade our platform where, people living in regions nearby to disaster stricken areas whose are in a condition and willing to help in relief program can give information regarding the free space available in their houses which can later be used to provide shelter to people. Similar can also be done for hospitals who can give information regarding the number of free beds available.
